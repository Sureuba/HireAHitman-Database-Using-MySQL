# Hire a Hitman (MySQL- Database)

## Hire a Hitman: plotcrimesforme.com 
Do you need someone to die? Are you afraid of being caught by the police? Look no further than plotcrimesforme.com! 
Unfortunately, society lacks a structured and secure platform for individuals wishing to organize activities such as hiring hitmen — leading to disorganization, safety risks, and potential exposure to law enforcement. Our motivation comes from the need to address the severe lack of safe platforms for criminal planning, while emphasizing the importance of ease for clients and providing a strong backend database system for connecting you to the right hitman for the job. 
For the sake of this proposal, plotcrimesforme.com is our satirical web platform designed to address the planning and organizing of hits. Our website offers a highly secure, curated platform that helps clients plan and organize their hits, matching them with hitmen and other necessary services based on their preferences.
This proposal will further elaborate on the nature of the problem, our proposed solution, our motivations for developing the site, and how it will be implemented. 

## What problem are we solving?
Murder has existed since the beginning of civilization, and pillaging used to be cool! But now it's punishable by law. The means of committing such atrocities is disjointed and harder than ever to organize; one would have to rely on underground networks and informal communication methods, which pose great risks to both clients and participants. 
The problem of efficiently organizing crime is intriguing because of the psychology behind it; despite its clear illegality, many individuals still seek ways to engage in criminal activities, often falling prey to poor planning, fraud, or law enforcement. 
The main problem occurs when individuals or groups attempt to organize these activities without access to a reliable method such as our website. Traditional methods expose them to risks such as a botched job, and there are no known legal or secure solutions otherwise, as most platforms shy away from offering any support due to legal and ethical constraints. Current practices involve using the dark web, which is risky and often unreliable. 

While there are black-market platforms on the dark web, these solutions are filled with potential consequences and lack of ease. Our platform will provide a user-friendly interface with a top-tier backend system which can match our clients to their perfect hit man in order to get the job done. 

## How do we solve this problem?
plotcrimesforme.com aims to provide an anonymous platform for individuals to organize hits. It guarantees privacy, safety, and a wide selection of customizable services, ranging from choosing the type of weapon to scheduling and tracking the event progress, all while recommending the best hit man for the job. 
Our team will produce a website that includes several core features:
A client-side interface allowing users to customize their “dream hit.”
A client dashboard that allows users to input their target details, select the murder method, time, and location preferences. 
A backend hitman selection algorithm that recommends professional hitmen based on user preferences and previous success rates. 
Further search and filter features will be added in order to satisfy further needs.

## What motivates us?
Due to societal norms, individuals have no access to a safe and secure platform that allows them to efficiently plan certain actions, like the hiring of a hitman. With our website, we aim to target and resolve these issues, as our platform is clear and concise to ensure that the clients are not overwhelmed by the process. Furthermore, we are motivated by the need to ensure anonymity; thus our website is completely incognito, and the hitmen in our database have been vetted to ensure there are no leaks or moles within the system.

## Why plotcrimesforme.com?
plotcrimesforme.com focuses on a niche area — helping users who are wary of legal repercussions to organize high-stakes plans. Its unique proposition to cater to these specific needs distinguishes it from any conventional organizational platform. Our platform allows for users to create their ideal hit based on their specific desires or requirements, and we then match our client to the best suited hitman, thus ensuring that both sides of the parties are satisfied. Additionally, our platform is a much safer alternative instead of the dark web which not only can be dangerous but can result in a myriad of unwanted consequences. 

Narrowing down on the broad scheme of things, plotcrimesforme.com is a secure and innovative platform designed to help users plan and organize hits. It delivers a specialized service to those who feel constrained by society’s legal boundaries. Overall our site will contribute to the world of underground crime by ensuring anonymity, offering professional recommendations, and allowing clients to carry out their illicit goals in a secure manner.
